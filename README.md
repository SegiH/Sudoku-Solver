Sudoku Solver
Sudoku Solver will help you to solve a Sudoku puzzle. Enter the numbers that you already know and click on analyze.

Hovering over each cell will show you the possible choices for that cell. If there is only 1 possible choice, it will be filled in automatically.

Keep on analyzing the Sudoku grid until it is filled in completely or you see a message that the grid cannot find any new possible answers.
